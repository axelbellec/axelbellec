## 👋 Hey there!

I'm Axel, a **Software Engineer** at [Synapse Medicine](https://synapse-medicine.com/) in beautiful [Bordeaux, France 🇫🇷](https://www.google.com/maps?q=bordeaux). My sweet spots are **data science**, **data engineering**, and **back-end development**, where I love building scalable systems and bringing DevOps practices into the mix.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm passionate about technology and enjoy understanding systems in depth. I stay current with industry developments and new technologies, particularly in the AI space. The rapid evolution of AI technologies has captured my interest, and I actively look for ways to integrate these tools into practical applications.

I thrive at the intersection of technology and innovation, combining technical expertise with modern tools to deliver impactful solutions. My ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies allows me to effectively turn concepts into practical implementations.

My sweet spot? Being right where tech meets innovation. I get a kick out of combining my coding chops with cutting-edge tools to build solutions that don't just work, but make a real difference to the business. Give me a thorny problem to solve, and I'm in my element! One of my strongest assets is my ability to quickly ramp up on new technologies and turn ideas into practical solutions – I thrive on that rapid learning-to-implementation cycle.

## 🚀 What Gets Me Excited

- **Data Engineering:** There's something deeply satisfying about crafting efficient ETL processes and data pipelines. I love using big data tech to turn raw data into gold.
- **Back-End Development:** Give me Python, Go, Typescript or any other language, and I'll build you rock-solid APIs and microservices that can handle whatever you throw at them. Thanks to my solid programming foundations, I can quickly get up to speed with any new language or technology.
- **DevOps:** I'm all about making life easier with CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and infrastructure as code. Because who doesn't love a smooth deployment?
- **Machine Learning & AI:**  
  - Data analysis and feature engineering still get me pumped – they're the backbone of making smart decisions.
  - There's nothing quite like seeing a model you've built and nurtured performing like a champ in production.
- **LLM Era:**
  - I geek out over prompt engineering and fine-tuning Large Language Models.
  - Getting LLMs to play nice in production? That's my kind of challenge!
- **My Go-To Tools:** 
  - **Languages:** Python, Go, Typescript etc. – each one's like a trusted friend for different jobs.
  - **Databases:** From SQL to graph databases (both property graphs and triplestores) to document stores, I love picking the right tool to make data sing.
